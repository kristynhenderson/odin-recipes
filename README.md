# Recipes - The Odin Project

This project was created to practice and show the foundational knowledge of HTML I have gained as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>'s Foundations Course. It includes the use of the elements, tags, and attributes required to build a real, working website. As I work through the curriculum, I will continuously improve the appearance of the website with CSS.

The recipes chosen were inspired by my southern upbringing, featuring recipes served at a number of family gatherings. I swapped a few ingredients of the original recipes (<a href="https://www.overstuffedlife.com/lime-jello-salad-cream-cheese-marshmallows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lime Jell-O Fluff</a>, <a href="https://www.shakentogetherlife.com/easy-banana-pudding-with-vanilla-wafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanilla Banana Pudding</a>, <a href="https://www.eatingonadime.com/sherbet-punch-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lime Sherbet Punch</a>) for what I remember enjoying. Have a look!
